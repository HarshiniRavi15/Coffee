            <pre>                * Everyone loves their morning coffee, and everyone has their own version of what they consider their coffee drink. 
                
                * Some like it black or with milk, others drink lattes and may add flavors or sweet syrups. 
                
                * Many even drink the trendy Bulletproof coffee, which has butter and MCT oil in it. 
                
                * However, all of these different types of coffee affect the body differently. 
                
                * One example is espresso. There are health advantages for the daily latte and espresso drinkers that most people are probably not even aware of.
