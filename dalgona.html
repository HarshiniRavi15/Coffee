                * Basically, it's a whipped drink that consists of five easily-available household ingredients - instant coffee powder, hot water, sugar, milk and ice. 
                
                * The drink was popularised on social media as people stay at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and became viral, especially on TikTok.

                * The drink, whose name derived from dalgona - a Korean sugar - due to its resemblance in taste and appearance, has become the most searched type of coffee worldwide.
